        	<div class="how-it-works"><h2>How does this work?</h2>
        	<p><a href="https://cheaptranscription.io/">CheapTranscription.io</a> uses machine learning to "listen" to your recordings and create automatic transcriptions. Audio transcription is traditionally resource intensive but thanks to new methods and systems we are able to turn any audio file into text in a few seconds. We are spending money on technology instead of flashy websites and interfaces. Audio in, text out.</p>
<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
<p>Automated transcriptions cost 10 cents per minute and human edited transcriptions cost 85 cents a minute.</p>            
<h2>How long does it take?</h2>
<p>Automated transcriptions should take less than five minutes and human transcriptions can take up to twelve hours.</p>
<h2>What do you do with my recordings?</h2>
<p>We delete all of your personal information after completing your job. We will do everything reasonable to protect your privacy on the site but we cannot be responsible for trade secrets and the like. Please contact us if you need special security for your transcriptions.</p>
<h2>Who runs it?</h2>
            <p><a href="http://bigwidelogic.com">John Biggs</a> and <a href="https://www.edisonave.com">Tom Printy</a> run <a href="https://cheaptranscription.io/">CheapTranscription.io</a>. They met at Watterson High School and spent years writing and programming. John is a journalist and Tom is a developer.</p>
			<h2>Do you use humans?</h2>
            <p>Yes, we do. We offer two types of transcription: fast, inexpensive robotic transcription and a human augmented version that will send your text to a human for checking. Automatic transcription takes a few minutes while human transcription can take up to twelve hours.</p>
						<h2>Why is it so cheap?</h2>
            <p>Our lowest pricing tier depends entirely on machine learning for transcription. That way we can reduce the price to the absolute minimum. This also means that you may have some garbled text in your output. </p>
            <h2>I'm very angry/pleased. How can I contact you?</h2>
            <p>Drop us a line at <a href="mailto:team@cheaptranscription.io">team@cheaptranscription.io</a>!</p>
            <h2>Will robots take over the world?</h2>
<p>We hope not. That said, we believe that transcription is a business that is ripe for disruption. We're excited to build something that helps change it.</p></div>
